// DYNAMIC ROUTING <EIGRP> CONFIGURATIONS
// This for CISCO made devices.

// A router needs to advertise its network behind it 
// for another router in the same network to access all its network as 
// a neighbor network

# conf t

#$ router eigrp [provide your autnomous number [10]] 
// must be same in all router

#$ network [provide network [10.10.10.0]]
// Provide the network behind the router to be accessed by other network 

#$ do show ip route // confirm network ROUTING
#$ do show ip eigrp neighbor // show neighbor network
#$ end // done


// Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) is a network protocol 
// that enables routers to exchange information more efficiently than earlier 
// network protocols, such as Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP) or 
// Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).
